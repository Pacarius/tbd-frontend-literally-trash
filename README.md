# Bookmark Library

A standalone, local-only frontend for `twitter-bookmarks-downloader`.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local Vite URL, choose the downloader's `bookmarks.db`, then choose
the `media/` directory if you want local image and video previews. Tags are
written into the in-memory SQLite copy and can be saved with **Download tagged
database**. Replace your original database with that downloaded file when you
want to keep the changes.

The database is parsed and edited in the browser with SQLite/WASM. Nothing is
uploaded and the downloader does not need to be running. The app supports both
the downloader's legacy GORM schema and its current Ent schema.

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
